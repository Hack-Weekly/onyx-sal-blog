# Installation Instructions

### Make sure you are in the root directory:
./onyx-sal-blog
## Steps to start the app locally

1. ``` npm run quick ```
    - Is a quick script that will install all needed dependencies that will allow for the application to run correctly. 
2. ``` npm run start ```
    - This will spin up the react app (frontend)
3. ``` cd ./server && npm run start ```
    - Will spin up a local instance of the server. However, you will need to create your own .env file and ensure you have the correct information in the .env file so that way you can make a connection to the database.
