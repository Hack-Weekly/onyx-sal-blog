# Onyx Blog

Welcome to the ```Onyx Salamanders blog```, where the Hack Weekly team tracks their progress as they collaborate to build and develop full stack apps within a set deadline. We are excited to share our journey with you!

Our project selection process is based on a poll taken by hundreds of members on the Hack Weekly Discord server. The chosen project becomes the focus of our team, as we work diligently to create a functional and user-friendly application.

As an admin of Onyx, you can easily log in and create blog posts to keep our community updated on our progress. Other users can also log in and authenticate via Github OAuth to share their thoughts and ideas in the comments section.

We've also included a metrics page that offers insight into different aspects of our blog, such as the total number of words and the various tags that we use. This helps us analyze our writing style and content, allowing us to make improvements and adjustments to better engage with our audience.

We're thrilled to be working on exciting projects and sharing our progress with our community. We hope that you'll join us on this journey and be a part of our growth and success as we continue to build and develop innovative apps.

# Installation Instructions

### Make sure you are in the root directory:

2. ``` npm run start ```
    - This will spin up the react app (frontend)
3. ``` cd ./server && npm run start ```
    - Will spin up a local instance of the server. However, you will need to create your own .env file and ensure you have the correct information in the .env file so that way you can make a connection to the database.
